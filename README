This was my first python project, the code is a bit messy. I'm working on cleaning it up...


In order for this to work the user needs to download and install an emulator
that is capable of running the original Super Mario Bros on NES. I'm not going
to go into how to do that there are many guides and websites online to help
set up the emulator and get the rom downloaded.

This program works by reading in the game screen.
